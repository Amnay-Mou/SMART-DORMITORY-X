ABSTRACT

The goal of Smart Dormitory X (SDX) is to make dormitory management simpler, easier, and more contemporary. One of its main objectives is to reduce the inefficiency of traditional techniques, such as manual paper lists and data collection, which hinder effective management and waste time, money, and human resources. SDX provides a user-friendly interface accessible across all devices to ensure ease of use for all students. With the “Contact Us” service, SDX aims to help users resolve any issues they may encounter. Access to the platform is login-based, allowing users to access a range of services including checking payment lists, creating new lists, accessing user information, and creating reports or requests for any service or problem. That is the usual user but if the administrative is trying to log into SDX, it should have a role in the database is 0, which allows the platform to redirect the user to the Administrative Interface, this menu allows the administration to manage all the platform for example check payment made by users, check information for every user, contact any user, answer all questions and other services. Additionally, users with administrative privileges can access an administration interface to efficiently manage all aspects of the platform. By encrypting all passwords and utilizing strong database systems, our platform places a high priority on user data security. This ensures that you will receive your request and service more quickly, as well as attend to inquiries and afford your request (fixed, repaired, and renewed). To put it briefly, Smart Dormitory X (SDX) upgrades dorm administration by streamlining procedures, guaranteeing user accessibility, and putting security first. With its intuitive UI and extensive offerings, SDX helps students be more productive and live better. SDX ensures user data security by utilizing strong database systems and encryption. Furthermore, SDX is an essential tool for improving the entire dorm experience because of its administrative skills, which allow for the effective supervision of all operations.
